# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pad 5

## Reinstallation
If you don't like your Windows version or you've bricked your Windows install, or anything else, you would probably just reinstall Windows. Thankfully this process is very easy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Quite obviously, this will erase all of your Windows files. If you'd like to back up any of them, you can do so by mounting Windows using the [WOA Helper](https://github.com/erdilS/Port-Windows-11-Xiaomi-Pad-5/releases/download/dualboot/woahelper.apk) app and manually copying any files you wish to keep

### Prerequisites
- ```Existing Windows and boot partitions``` (*If not met, [go back and just pretend this guide never existed](/guide/Vietnamese/1-partition-vi.md)*)

- [```Recovery Image```](https://github.com/erdilS/Port-Windows-11-Xiaomi-Pad-5/releases/download/1.0/recovery.img)

- [```Android platform tools```](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

#### Reboot into fastboot mode
- Boot your NABU into **fastboot mode** by holding down the **`volume down`** button while rebooting with a USB cable connected
- Or, if you have USB debugging enabled, run the below command while booted into Android.
```cmd
adb reboot bootloader
```

### Boot modified recovery
> Replace `path\to\recovery.img` with the actual path of the modded recovery image
```cmd
fastboot boot path\to\recovery.img
```

### Format the partitions
> If it asks you to run it once again, do so
```cmd
adb shell format
```
