# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pad 5

## Troubleshooting Issues

## I can't move files to the Windows folder from Android 

If you are unable to move files to the Windows folder, it means you shut down Windows instead of restarting it. To fix this issue, boot back to Windows and use restart, then as it restarts boot to fastboot and use it to return to Android

##### Done!
## Device is not recognized in fastboot or recovery
> This likely means you don't have (proper) USB drivers installed
- Download [QUD.zip](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-betalm/releases/download/Qfil/QUD.zip) here and extract it.
- Open Device Manager and find an unknown device or device with errors that may be called **Android**, **ADB Interface**, or **QUSB_BULK**.
- Right click this devjce, select "Update Drivers" > "Browse files", then select the **QUD folder** you extracted before.

##### Finished!

## Charging in Windows does not work
> [!WARNING]
> Do not use a powered USB hub with host mode enabled, this can potentially break your device. If you use a powered USB hub, please use the [disable USB host mode guide](/guide/Vietnamese/Additional-materials-en.md#Disabling-USB-host-mode)

Charging in Windows only works on specific cables. Cables that have been known to work are the original Poco X3 Pro cable (identified by the additional orange/red pin in the USB-A port), and the Nimaso 100W USB-C to USB-C fast charging cable.

##### Done!

## NABU in fastboot is not detected by my PC/Laptop, what should I do?
- Download [**`QUD.zip`**](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-betalm/releases/download/Qfil/QUD.zip) and extract it.
- Open Device Manager and find an unknown device or device with errors that may be called Android or QUSB_BULK.
- Right click it, select **```Update Drivers```** â†’ **`Browse files`**, then select the QUD folder you extracted before.

### Prerequisites:
- [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)

- [Android platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

- [SHRP Recovery](https://github.com/erdilS/Port-Windows-11-Xiaomi-Pad-5/releases/download/1.0/SHRP.img)

#### If you have access to Android:
- Install **Termux** and grant it root access.
- Install **tsu** and **parted** using these two commands, press `Y` if it asks you to confirm:
```cmd
pkg install tsu
```
```cmd
pkg install parted
```
- Run the below command to open parted:
```cmd
parted /dev/block/sda
```
- Run ```print``` to list all partitions.
- Look for partitions that are more than 16 characters long, for example "Basic Data Partition" and note their volume number.
- Rename this partition with ```name $ test```, replacing **$** with the partition number, and replacing **test** with the name you want the partition to have.
- Run ```quit```.

##### Done!


#### If you have access to Windows:
- Rename **C:\boot.img** to **C:\bootb.img**.
- Download the **SHRP recovery** image, rename it to **boot.img**, and place it in `C:\`.
- Run the **Switch to Android** or **Android** shortcut to flash and boot into SHRP recovery.
- Once booted into the recovery, connect your device to your PC and run:
```cmd
adb shell parted /dev/block/sda
```
- Run ```print``` to list all partitions.
- Look for partitions that are more than 16 characters long, for example "Basic Data Partition" and note their volume number.
- Rename this partition with ```name $ test```, replacing **$** with the partition number, and replacing **test** with the name you want the partition to have.
- Run ```quit```.
- Run ```adb reboot bootloader```, and when you see the **FASTBOOT** logo on your screen, flash your Android boot image with ```fastboot flash boot_a path\to\boot.img```.
- You may have to do the same for **boot_b** if your device does not boot, or if it boots back to the recovery.
